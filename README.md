# PDFMerger

<br>C# based application that allow merging/spliting PDF files with 3 different modes:
<ul>
  <li>Normal
    <br/>This will create a new PDF file with all pages from PDF1, then PDF2, PDF3, etc.
  </li>
  <li>Alternate
    <br/>Only supports 2 input files and the output will be PDF1-Page1, PDF2-Page1, PDF1-Page2, PDF2-Page2. 
    This mode was created when I had a single side scanner and was generating 2 PDF files, one with odd pages and the other with even pages.
  </li>
  <li>Split
    <br/>Only accepts a single file and will create one PDF file per page from the input PDF file.PDF Merger Release Notes
